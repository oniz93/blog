I'll try to make a platform that will permit to people to publish their thoughts anonymously.<br />
<br />
In this repository will be only the code for the static frontend of the site.
<br /><br />
People will send their post blog to an API trought a form, the API will include the post to the Jekyll repo and commit the files in this repository, after that I hope that the new post will appear.<br /><br />
I'll increase the documentation while I'll develop this thing
