I'll try to make a platform that will permit to people to publish their thoughts anonymously.
In this repository will be only the code for the static frontend of the site.
People will send their post blog to an API trought a form, the API will include the post to the Jekyll repo and commit the files in this repository, after that I hope that the new post will appear.
I'll increase the documentation while I'll develop this thing
